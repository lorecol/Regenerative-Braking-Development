## General information

**Functioning**\
Record voltage and temperature data from a block of cells (i.e. a series of three modules, which are four cells in parallel) via a microcontroller connected to it, which samples with a frequency of 10 Hz. The microcontroller provides three voltage measurements (for the 3 parallels in the configuration) and four temperature measurements, which are carried out through NTC sensors.

**Goal**\
Record temperature and voltage data for a 3s4p battery configuration via a microcontroller.

## How to use
- Connect the battery to the instrument.
- [Connect the instrument to the PC](../../DOCS/Keysight_regenerative_power_supply/Interface_Connections.pdf).
- Run the Matlab script [mainSerialDataLog.m](mainSerialDataLog.m).
- A .txt file is created in the output folder where data is saved:
  - Four measures of temperature (`Â°C`)
  - Three measures of voltage (`V`)
